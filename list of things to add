login game stuff:

First day on the job at a new company, and you need to sign into your companies website to do your work.
You are given an ID, but dont have a password. Thats because you need to make one silly!! and the rabbit hole ensues.

Final game is given in the form of a fake OS with files and a browser, for now we just make the web pages.

-Need to find username by entering email and the date of account creation, found in email.
-Need to enter security question, found by clues in the name of your email or something
-typing too fast or slow resets you
